# Ubuntu (NodeJS)

This tutorial will explain how to run UNiD EDGE SDK on Ubuntu (NodeJS) environment. This tutorial is organized into 4 chapters as shown below, so that you can try all the features of UNiD EDGE SDK by following the tutorial. The execution environment required to proceed with the tutorial is defined below.

* Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa) on x86\_64

In addition, UNiD EDGE SDK communicates with the Internet for creating DID (**D**ecentralized **ID**entifiers), applying digital signature, and verifying the digital signature. Please make sure that your environment is connected to the Internet before proceeding with the tutorial.
