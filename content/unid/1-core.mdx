### DID Operations

Regardless of the DID method supported by UNiD Drivers, all DID methods support the following DID Operations.
Each DID method MUST define how authorization is implemented, including any necessary cryptographic operations.

1. **Create**

    The DID method specification MUST specify how a DID controller creates a DID and its associated DID document on the verifiable data registry,
    including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control.

2. **Read/Verify**

    The DID method specification MUST specify how a DID resolver uses a DID to request a DID document from the verifiable data registry,
    including how the DID resolver can verify the authenticity of the response.

3. **Update**

    The DID method specification MUST specify how a DID controller can update a DID document on the verifiable data registry,
    including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control, or state that updates are not possible.

    An update to a DID is any change, after creation, in the data used to produce a DID document.
    DID Method implementers are responsible for defining what constitutes an update, and what properties of the DID document are supported by a given DID method. For example, an update operation which replaces key material without changing it could be a valid update that does not result in changes to the DID document.

4. **Deactivate**

    The DID method specification MUST specify how a DID controller can deactivate a DID on the verifiable data registry,
    including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of deactivation, or state that deactivation is not possible.

### DID Comm

DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another.
It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities,
which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is,
barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that DID.

2. **QR Support**

### Verifiable Credential

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to claim that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle,
university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries.
This sort of credentials can be expressed on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.
We call it as a `Verifiable Credential`.

In the physical world, a credential might consist of:
- Information related to identifying the subject of the credential (for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
- Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government, national agency, or certification body)
- Information related to the type of credential this is (for example, a Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
- Information related to specific attributes or properties being asserted by the issuing authority about the subject (for example, nationality, the classes of vehicle entitled to drive, or date of birth)
- Evidence related to how the credential was derived
- Information related to constraints on the credential (for example, expiration date, or terms of use).

A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents.
The addition of technologies, such as digital signatures, makes verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.
UNiD Core supports create, store, retrieve, manage, and delete of verifiable credentials based on JSON-LD data formats.
