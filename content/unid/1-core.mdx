### Verifiable Credential

（VCの説明）
Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to claim that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries. This sort of credentials can be expressed on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable. We call it as a `Verifiable Credential`.

In the physical world, a credential might consist of:
- Information related to identifying the subject of the credential (for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
- Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government, national agency, or certification body)
- Information related to the type of credential this is (for example, a Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
- Information related to specific attributes or properties being asserted by the issuing authority about the subject (for example, nationality, the classes of vehicle entitled to drive, or date of birth)
- Evidence related to how the credential was derived
- Information related to constraints on the credential (for example, expiration date, or terms of use).

A verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents. The addition of technologies, such as digital signatures, makes verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts.
