### DID AuthN

**SIOP DID**

SIOP DID Profile is a DID AuthN flavor to use OpenID Connect together with the strong decentralized, privacy and security guarantees of DID for everyone who wants to have a generic way to integrate identity wallet into their web applications.

The work on [DIF SIOP DID Profile v1 specification](https://identity.foundation/did-siop/) has moved to OIDF AB WG to work on a new SIOP v2 specification that will either introduce breaking changes to the DIF SIOP DID Profile specification or will replace it with an implementation guide document on how to use SIOP v2 in an SSI context.
