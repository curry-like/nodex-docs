### DID Method Support

DID methods provide the means to implement this specification on different verifiable data registries.
New DID methods are defined in their own specifications, so that interoperability between different implementations of the same DID method is ensured.
This section specifies the requirements on any DID method, which are met by the DID method's associated specification.

**Currently Supported DID Methods**
- `did:unid`
- `did:ion`
- `did:{custom_method}`

### Storage Support

UNiD Platform supports building UNiD Secure Data Storage (SDS) to be pre-configured on Amazon Web Services for each tenant.
