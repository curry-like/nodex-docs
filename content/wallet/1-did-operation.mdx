UNiD Core supports a variety of DID operations, all of which require the DID owner to generate specific data values and cryptographic material. This page below describe how to perform each type of operation.

### Generate New DID

With the SDK, you can easily generate a master seed with BIP39 and key pairs using SECP256K1 with ECDSA algorithm and the payload required for DID register operation.

```js
import { UNiD, KeyRingType } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
	    const DID = await UNiD.createDid(
			// Select KeyRingType Option. Default length is 24.
			KeyRingType.Mnemonic,
			{ length: 24 }
		);
	    console.log("complete creating a DID:", DID.getIdentifier());
	} catch(err){
	    console.err(err);
	};
})()
```

After generating a master seed, it can get the seed phrase, which is a list of words which store all the information needed to recover the master seed. Once the server validates the seed phrase, it cannot be displayed again.

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		// load DID object (DID object has methods)
	    const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
	    const seedPhrase = await DID.getSeedPhrase();
	    console.log("complete getting the seed phrase:", seedPhrase);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
	    const result = await DID.verifySeedPhrase([
			"word_1", "word_2",...,"word_24"
		]);
	    console.log("complete verifying the seed phrase:", result)
	} catch(err){
		console.err(err);
	};
})()
```


After a while, the queued operation will be periodically extracted and executed by a Batch Txn Writer and is submitted into the underlying ledger system. If you want to know more detailed the operating principle, please refer to [the specification](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/).


### Resolve DID

After the register operation is successfully processed in the underlying distributed ledger network, you can resolve the original DID. UNiD SDKs allow you to resolve a DID while verifying the authenticity of the response.

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.getDidDocument({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
		console.log("Complete getting the DID Document:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

If you have already created a DID instance, you can get the DID Document by the following method.

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
	    const didDocument = await DID.getDidDocument();
	    console.log("Complete getting the DID Document:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

Great! Now that you've completed to create and register new DID. Next is to issue and exchange a verifiable credential. [VC Operations](./2-verifiable-credential).


### Update DID

Update DID document when adding, changing, and deleting public keys or service endpoints.

To add public keys:

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.updateDidDocument({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
			action: "add-public-keys",
			"publicKeys": [{
		    	"id": "key1",
				"purposes": ["authentication"],
				"type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
				"publicKeyJwk": {...}
			}]
		});
		console.log("Complete adding public keys:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

To remove public keys:
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.updateDidDocument({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
			action: "remove-public-keys",
			"ids": ["key1", "key2"]
		});
		console.log("Complete removing public keys:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

To add services:

```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.updateDidDocument({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
			action: "add-services",
			"services": [{
				"id": "sds2",
				"type": "SecureDataStore",
				"serviceEndpoint": "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sds.unid.plus/"
			},
			{
				"id": "did-config",
				"type": "LinkedDomains",
				"serviceEndpoint": {
					"origins": ["https://foo.com", "https://bar.com"]
				}
			}]
		});
		console.log("Complete adding service endpoints:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

To remove services:
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.updateDidDocument({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
			action: "remove-services",
			"ids": ["sds1", "sds2"]
		});
		console.log("Complete removing service endpoints:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```

To replace:
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
	try{
		const didDocument = await UNiD.updateDidDocument({
		  "action": "replace",
		  "document": {
		    "publicKeys": [
		      {
		        "id": "key2",
		        "purposes": ["authentication"],
		        "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
		        "publicKeyJwk": {...}
		      }
		    ],
		    "services": [
		      {
		        "id": "sds3",
		        "type": "SecureDataStore",
		        "serviceEndpoint": "http://hub.my-personal-server.com"
		      }
		    ]
		  }
		});
		console.log("Complete removing service endpoints:", didDocument);
	} catch(err){
		console.log(err);
	}
})()
```
