On this page, we will demonstrate how to create a verifiable credential in a JSON-LD format adhering to the [W3C VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

### VC Lifecycle
This section provides a concrete set of simple but complete lifecycle examples of the data model expressed in one of the concrete syntaxes supported by this specification. The lifecycle of credentials and presentations in the Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem often take a common path:

1. Issuance of one or more verifiable credentials.
2. Storage of verifiable credentials in a secure data storage (SDS).
3. Composition of verifiable credentials into a verifiable presentation for verifiers.
4. Verification of the verifiable presentation by the verifier.

### Create SIVC
Here, we introduce how to create SIVC (Self-Issued Verifiable Credential) by the holder himself or herself. For example, SIVC is used to storage personal identifiable information consisting of name, birthday, and address, etc. when registering as a user of wallet application.

However, third parties can not trust the data claimed by users themselves. So initially, SIVC needs to be submitted to a third party for verification. After verification, the third party can issue a new VC to the user.

Now let's create an [AddressCredentialV1](../schemas/address) through UNiD React Native SDK.

**DID.createCredential()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try{
        const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
        const AddressCredentialV1 = DID.createCredential<AddressCredentialV1>({
            @type: "AddressPerson",
            postalCode: "1500044",
            addressCountry: "JP",
            addressLocality: "Tokyo",
            addressRegion: "Shibuya-ku",
            streetAddress: "5-5, Marumaya-cho"
        });
        console.log("Complete creating credential:", AddressCredentialV1)
    } catch(err){
        console.err(err);
    };
})()
```
In UNiD network, we ensure interoperability by referring to the VC data schema defined [here](../schemas). If you want to generate a new type of VC schema that is not in the UNiD VC schema list, you can request it. For more information, see [Request VC schema](../tutorial/3-howtorequestvcschema).

Great! Now that you've completed to create a verifiable credential with JSON-LD data format. Next is to storage the credential to the UNiD SDS (Secure Data Storage).

### Storage VC in SDS

The wallet can securely access authorized SDS endpoints. The VCs are always encrypted and stored in the SDS in a privacy-preserving manner.

<!-- https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/ -->

**DID.postCredential()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try{
        const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
        const result = await DID.postCredential(AddressCredentialV1);
        console.log("Complete storing the credential to SDS:", result)
    } catch(err){
        console.err(err);
    };
})()
```
UNiD SDS validate every requests to see if the wallet is authorized to access the SDS and if the request has been tampered with.

Great! Now that you've completed to storage a VC to SDS. Next is to get selectively credentials stored in SDS and create a verifiable presentation.

### Composition of VC into VP
The wallet can fetch the newest record using `type`, `issuer_did`, and `issuance_date` of the stored VC.

**DID.getCredential()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try {
        const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
        const credential = await DID.getCredential({
            type: "AddressCredentialV1",
            issuer: "did:unid:test:issuer_12345678#keys-1",
            issuance_date: {
                begin: new Date("2020-01-01"),
                end: new Date("2020-12-31")
            }
        });
        console.log("Complete getting the latest credential from SDS:", credential);
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);
    }
})()
```

To get all applicable credentials with options of DID.getCredentials:

**DID.getCredentials()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try {
        const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
        const credentials = DID.getCredentials({
            type: "AddressCredentialV1",
            issuer: "did:unid:test:issuer_123456789",
            issuance_date: {
                begin: new Date("2020-01-01"),
                end: new Date("2020-12-31")
            },
            limit: 25,
            page: 1
        });
        console.log("Complete getting credentials from SDS:", credentials);
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);
    }
})()
```

After getting credentials, they will be packaged in verifiable presentation with `VerifiablePresentation` type and the value of the proof property.

**DID.createPresentation()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try {
        const DID = await UNiD.loadDid({
			did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
		});
        const presentation = await DID.createPresentation(credentials);
        console.log("Complete creating a presentation:", presentation);
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);
    }
})()
```

### Submit VP to Verifier

There are two main methods to submit VP to a verifier. The first one is to include the VP in the DID authentication response and submit it to a verifier. See more information in [the section of DID Communication](./3-did-auth). The second one is to storage the VP in SDS and grant access to the VP to the verifier.

### Verify VC from Issuer

The wallet verifies the digital signature of the VC from an issuer.

**UNiD.validateCredential()**
```js
import { UNiD } from "@unid/react-native-sdk";

(async () => {
    try {
        const result = await UNiD.validateCredential(presentation);
        console.log("Complete validating a presentation:", result);
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);
    }
})()
```
