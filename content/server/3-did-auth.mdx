### DID AuthN

For the application server to communicate with identity wallet on secure authenticated channel, UNiD Node SDKs provide methods of:

- generating DID AuthN Request
- validating DID AuthN request from an identity wallet

The below diagram illustrate the sign-in flow and steps taken to verify a user through their user agent from the wallet side of the webpage to the server side of a RP. If you want to see more details of DID AuthN, please head over [here](../unid/3-extensions).

### Generate DID AuthN Request

In step 2 of the diagram, the application server creates a DID AuthN request signed by the application's DID. The application server can specify the credential type as the information required for authentication.

**DID.generateAuthenticationRequest()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/node-unid-server-sdk";

try {
    var result = async DID.generateAuthenticationRequest({
        required_types: ["AddressCredentialV1", "NameCredentialV1", "EmailCredentialV1"],
        optional_types: ["GenderCredentialV1"]
    });
    console.log('success', result)
} catch err(err){
    console.err(err);
};
```

### Validate AuthN Response

In step 9 of the diagram, the application server receives an authN response from the identity wallet. The application server queries for the wallet's DID document using a Universal Resolver and verifies the signature with the wallet's public key.

**Unid.validateAuthenticationResponse()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/node-unid-server-sdk";

try {
    var result = async Unid.validateAuthenticationRequest(applicationDid);
    console.log('validated', result);
} catch err(err){
    console.err(err);
};
```

If the required parameter or authorization code is not included in the response, an error will occur and the authentication process will be interrupted.
