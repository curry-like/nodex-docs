### Digital Trust

Our society has been established by reducing that complexity through trust. In the age of digital society, it is necessary to build solutions on common standards in order to trust and communicate smoothly with each other online.

<!--
Trust has been through three significant chapters in human history:

> We’ve moved from **local trust**, where it was based on one-to-one interactions and personal reputation.
> Next came **institutional trust**: when we went through mass urbanization and wanted to trade internationally, this local trust wasn’t scalable. So we invented institutions and institutional mechanisms.
> But over the years the flow of trust between people has dwindled while institutions have become bureaucratic, centralized and opaque.
> Technology is now taking that institutional power and distributing it, bringing us in to the third phase **distributed trust** according to Rachel Botsman.

The institutional trust system was not designed for a digital age, and we believe that it is necessary to implement a distributed trust system on web infrastructure in order to scale digital trust to the global demand of web system and the Internet today.

However, current web system do not have sufficient functionality to verify whether the data transferred is reliable in human social activity. Therefore, when using digital services, we are always required to create accounts and store a small part of our digital identity in the databases of these service providers. Consequently, digital identities become fragmented and locked into numerous different databases controlled by multiple external third parties.

The service providers are suffering from high operational costs for inefficient data processing and verification due to digital identity silos. In addition, as long as they retain personal data, they must continue to pay high costs for privacy protection and security, which have become increasingly responsible in recent year.

At [UNiD](./unid), we are focused on building tools that enable to connect people, machines, and services with digital trust. To achive this goal, it's important first step to establish a globally unique identity that can be controlled directly by a user without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

### Decentralized Identity

Decentralized identity, also know as self-sovereign identity (SSI), is a digital movement that evolves digital identity on the Internet based on open web standards at organizations such as the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/), [IETF](https://ietf.org/), and [the Hyperledger Project at the Linux Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/). A central part of the movement is the emerging standardization around Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) which is a new type of identifier to allow individuals to create and control their own unique identifiers.

In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.
Any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) can use these identifiers to obtain verifiable credential (VC) from trusted organizations and present these credentials as proof of claims about themselves.

[UNiD Platform](./unid) provides fundermental capabilities of operating DIDs, verifiable credentials, encrypted data storage, communications between DIDs in a privacy-preserving manner.

### Use Cases

**Intro to a digital student wallet**

In order to understand the roles in DID ecosystem and how to establish **digital trust**, we introduce a demonstration of a digital student wallet built on the top of UNiD platform. This demonstration shows passwordless login and credential issuance when students apply for transcripts to their university.

1. A student goes to an university website and read a QR code for login through his digital student wallet.
A student can easily login to the website without any password in a secure manner. A service provider (in this case, it may be a vendor or university) can provide a seamlessly onboarding process to students without retaining personal data in their database.

2. A student goes to transcript apply page and read a QR code for a request. The web application issues a transcript with the university's signature and send the credential of transcript to a student. Students can bring and present the credential to other parties as proof of his educational history.

This sort of credentials can be presented to enterprises for applying a job. The enterprise as a verifier can cryptographically verify that the credential is correct without contacting the issuer. That begins establishing **digital trust** around that DIDs by using it in their digital interactions. Through the [UNiD SDKs](./unid/3-extensions), our platform offers convenient and easy-to-access application logic to build such solutions and integrate with digital services that exist out of our platform.

**Wide variety of use cases**

Our platform is composed of a collection of microservices, allowing developers to combine pluggable and exntensible modular for flexibility and freedom of choice without compromising security for a wide variety of applications for:

- Online Banking
- Insurance
- Human Resource
- Eduation
- Healthcare
- Gig Economy
- B2B transaction
- SmartCity
- IoT
- Energy
- Travel
- Government

We are currently working on joint projects with leading companies in each industry to build **digital trust platform** together. [Click here for more info](https://collabogate.com)
