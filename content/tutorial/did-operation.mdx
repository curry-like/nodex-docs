# DID Operations

### Generate New DID

With default settings, UNiD SDK generates 3 pairs of keys (update, recovery, and singing) using [SECP256K1 with ECDSA algorithm](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ecdsa-secp256k1-2019/). And then compute hash from public key document. A public key document is a json value and it will be canonicalized by [JCS](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme-00.html) and generate a hash with [Multihash](https://multiformats.io/multihash/) format and SHA2-256 (which code is 18 or 0x12) is used for the hash function. Generate the base64-encoded entity including these hash values and document. As a result, `suffix_data` and `delta` are submitted to Sidetree by HTTP POST method.

```
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

KeyPairs = Unid.generateKeyPairs();
DID = Unid.registerDid(KeyPairs);

```

After a while, the queued operation will be periodically extracted and executed by Sidetree scheduler called **Batch Scheduler** and is submitted into Bitcoin blockchain. If you want to know more detailed the operating princile, please refer to [the specification](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/).

### Resolve DID

After the operation is successfully restored to the verifiable data registry, you can resolve (query) the original DID. UNiD DID Method supports to request a DID document from the verifiable data registry, including how the UNiD DID resolver can verify the authenticity of the response.

```
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

DidDocument = Unid.getDidDocument({
	did: "did:ion:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
});
```

Great! Now that you've completed to register and query a DID. ここではまだglobal uniqueな識別子を登録しただけです。Next is to create a verifiable credential and exchange it to build Web of Trust. [Issue a verifiable credential](./verifiable-credential).
