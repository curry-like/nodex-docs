On this page, we will demonstrate how to create a verifiable credential in a JSON-LD format adhering to the [W3C VC Data Model Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

For example, your tenant issues 

```
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

VC = Unid.createCredential({
    "issuer": {
        "id": "did:ion:test:z6MkndAHigYrXNpape7jgaC7jHiWwxzB3chuKUGXJg2b5RSj",
        "name": "tenant"
    },
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://schema.org"
    ],
    "subjectId": "did:ion:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
    "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "Course"
    ],
    "claims": {
        "givenName": "Taro",
        "familyName": "Yamada",
        "educationalCredentialAwarded": "Certificate Name"
    },
    "persist": false,
    "revocable": false
});
```

Great! Now that you've completed to create a verifiable credential. Next is to exchange a verifiable credential with others. [DID Authentication](./5-did-auth).
