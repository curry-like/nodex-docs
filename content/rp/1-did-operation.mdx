UNiD Core supports a variety of DID operations, all of which require the DID owner to generate specific data values and cryptographic material. This page below describe how to perform each type of operation.

### Generate New DID

With the Node RP SDK, you can easily generate key pairs using SECP256K1 with ECDSA algorithm and the payload required for DID register operation at RP's server side.

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/node-unid-rp-sdk";

var payload = Unid.createPayload();
Unid.registerDid(payload);
```

After a while, the queued operation will be periodically extracted and executed by [sidetree batch scheduler]() and is submitted into the underlying ledger system. If you want to know more detailed the operating principle, please refer to [the specification](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/).


### Resolve DID

After the register operation is successfully processed in the underlying distributed ledger network, you can resolve the original DID. UNiD SDKs allow you to resolve a DID while verifying the authenticity of the response.

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/node-unid-rp-sdk";

Unid.getDidDocument({
	did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg"
});
```

Great! Now that you've completed to create and register new DID. Next is to issue and exchange a verifiable credential. [VC Operations](./2-verifiable-credential).

### Update DID

Update DID document when adding, changing, and deleting public keys or service endpoints.

To add public keys:

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-wallet-sdk";

Unid.updateDidDocument({
	did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
	action: "add-public-keys",
	"publicKeys": [{
    	"id": "key1",
		"purposes": ["authentication"],
		"type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
		"publicKeyJwk": {...}
	}]
});
```

To remove public keys:
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-wallet-sdk";

Unid.updateDidDocument({
	did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
	action: "remove-public-keys",
	"ids": ["key1", "key2"]
});
```

To add services:

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

Unid.updateDidDocument({
	did: "did:unid:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
	action: "add-services",
	"services": [{
		"id": "sds2",
		"type": "SecureDataStore",
		"serviceEndpoint": "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sds.unid.plus/"
	},
	{
		"id": "did-config",
		"type": "LinkedDomains",
		"serviceEndpoint": {
			"origins": ["https://foo.com", "https://bar.com"]
		}
	}]
});
```

To remove services:
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

Unid.updateDidDocument({
	did: "did:ion:test:EiCsnBO7XrB9hL96xvQ2R846j_Ebuyg3HO5o4BOSoU7ffg",
	action: "remove-services",
	"ids": ["sds1", "sds2"]
});
```

To replace:
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

Unid.replaceDidDocument({
  "action": "replace",
  "document": {
    "publicKeys": [
      {
        "id": "key2",
        "purposes": ["authentication"],
        "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
        "publicKeyJwk": {...}
      }
    ],
    "services": [
      {
        "id": "sds3",
        "type": "SecureDataStore",
        "serviceEndpoint": "http://hub.my-personal-server.com"
      }
    ]
  }
});
```
