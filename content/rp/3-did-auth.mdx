DID-Auth
RP Application側に求められること
- authenticating a user with their DID
- requesting persmissions from a user to access data in SDS (V2)
- reading and/or writing data to user's SDS

### DID AuthN

For the wallet to communicate with relying parties (RP) on secure authenticated channel, UNiD wallet SDKs provide methods of:

- validating DID AuthN request from a RP
- generating DID AuthN response to a RP

The below diagram illustrate the sign-in flow and steps talen to verify a user through their user agent from the wallet side of the webpage to the server side of a RP. If you want to see more details of DID AuthN, please head over [here](../unid/3-extensions).

### Validate AuthN Request

In step 5 of the diagram, the wallet receives an authN request from the RP. The wallet queries for the RP's DID document using a Universal Resolver and verifies the signature with the RP's public key.

**Unid.validateAuthenticationRequest()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-wallet-sdk";

try {
    var result = async Unid.validateAuthenticationRequest(applicationDid);
    console.log('validated', result);
} catch err(err){
    console.err(err);
};
```

### Generate DID AuthN Response

In step 6 of the diagram, the wallet creates a DID AuthN response signed by the selected DID. The response object can envelop a verifiable presentation and will be put into a JWS signed by the DID.

**DID.generateAuthenticationResponse()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-wallet-sdk";

try {
    var result = async DID.generateAuthenticationResponse({
        requested_params: presentation
    });
    console.log('success', result)
} catch err(err){
    console.err(err);
};
```
