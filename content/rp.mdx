### Getting Started

UNiD RP SDKs offer convenient and easy-to-use Javascript module for operating DIDs and verifiable credentials through the underlying Core APIs and Drivers.
On this page, we get you up and running with Node.js SDK for issuing and verifying credentials with an existing application.

**Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- `Node.js v10.x or later`
- `npm v5.x or later`

If you don't already have an account and tenant setup, head over to [here](https://collabogate.com/products/index.html), then return to this page.

### Installing via NPM
The SDK is available on npmjs. Select the appropriate version that suits your application.

**Node.js**
```npm
npm install --save @unid/node-unid-rp-sdk
```
