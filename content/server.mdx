On this section, we introduce UNiD SDKs for building a wallet which provides storage of cryptographic keys and secrets with cloud servers. It is often implemented on an existing server to communicate with another identity wallet, such as authenticating or issuing credentials. At the moment, we support Node.js SDKs.

### Node.js

UNiD RP Server SDKs are used for embedding UNiD Core capabilities into exisiting application server in order to communicate with DID wallet.

On this page, we get you up and running with Node SDK which offers easy-to-use javascript module for DID operations, VC operations, and DID Comm through the underlying UNiD Core APIs and Drivers.

**Prerequisites**

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- `node v13.x.x or later`
- `npm v6.13.x or later`

If you don't already have an account and UNiD tenant established, head over to [here](https://getunid.io), then return to this page.

### Install

Add the `@unid/nodejs-sdk` dependency:
```bash
npm install --save @unid/nodejs-sdk
```

Please install and Set up MongoDB to store KeyRing.

### Configure

After you've completed setting up a tenant and a relying party application in UNiD, UNiD will give you values: `client_id` and `client_secret`. These values are used for authorization when the RP communicates with the wallet application and SDS endpoints.

```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/nodejs-sdk";

Unid.init({
    client_id: "client_id_token",
    client_secret: "client_secret_token",
    env_network: "testnet"
});
```


Great! Now that you've completed setting up the Node SDK. You can step forward to [Generate New DID](./server/1-did-operation).
