On this page, we will demonstrate how to create a verifiable credential in a JSON-LD format adhering to the [W3C VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

### VC Lifecycle
This section provides a concrete set of simple but complete lifecycle examples of the data model expressed in one of the concrete syntaxes supported by this specification. The lifecycle of credentials and presentations in the Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem often take a common path:

1. Issuance of one or more verifiable credentials.
2. Storage of verifiable credentials in a secure data storage (SDS).
3. Composition of verifiable credentials into a verifiable presentation for verifiers.
4. Verification of the verifiable presentation by the verifier.

### Create SIVC
Here, we introduce Self-Issued Verifiable Credential which issued by the holder himself or herself. SIVC is used to storage profile information for the wallet app, and it helps issuer to create new VC by submitting SIVC to issuer.

<!-- For example, in a matching platform that connects workers to employers, a worker want to prove his or her identification to employers. A worker can create and submit the SIVC of identification to employers. The employers verify the contents of SIVC comparing with the identity veirfication documents such as resident's card. After verification, the employer will issue new VC of identification to the worker. The network needs to trust its employer's validation results, but workers can reuse the credential issued by the employer. -->

Now let's create [AddressCredentialV1](../schemas/address) through UNiD React Native SDK.

**DID.createCredential()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-client-sdk";

try{
    var AddressCredentialV1 = DID.createCredential<AddressCredentialV1>({
        "@type": "AddressCredentialV1",
        "postalCode": "1500044",
        "addressCountry": "JP",
        "addressLocality": "Tokyo",
        "addressRegion": "Shibuya-ku",
        "streetAddress": "5-5, Marumaya-cho"
    });
    console.log('complete', AddressCredentialV1)
} catch(err){
    console.err(err);
};
```
In UNiD network, we ensure interoperability by referring to the VC data schema defined here. If you want to generate a new type of VC schema that is not in the [UNiD VC schema list](../schemas), you can request it. For more information, see [Request VC schema](../tutorial/3-howtorequestvcschema).

Great! Now that you've completed to create a verifiable credential with JSON-LD data format. Next is to storage the credential to the UNiD SDS (Secure Data Storage).

### Storage VC in SDS

The operating client can securely access the SDS endpoint in your tenant. The client can encrypt `AddressCredentialV1` using secp256k1 with ECDSA and storage it to the SDS in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

**DID.postCredential()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-client-sdk";
try {
    var result = async DID.postCredential(AddressCredentialV1);
    console.log('completed:', result);
} catch (err) {
    console.err(err);
};
```
The post requests are verified with holder's DID signature and tokens of application registered in your tenant.

Great! Now that you've completed to store a credential to SDS. Next is to get selectively credentials stored in SDS and make a verifiable presentation.

### Composition of VC into VP
The client can selectively fetch verifiable credentials with `type` of VC schema from the SDS.

**DID.getCredentials()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-client-sdk";
try {
    var credentials = DID.getCredentials({
        "types": [
            "NameCredentialV1",
            "BirthDateCredentialV1",
            "GenderCredentialV1",
            "ImageCredentialV1",
            "EmailCredentialV1",
            "PhoneCredentialV1",
            "AddressCredentialV1"
        ]
    });
    console.log('success', credentials);
} catch (err) {
    console.err(err);
}
```

After getting credentials, they will be packaged in verifiable presentation with `VerifiablePresentation` type and the value of the proof property.

**DID.createPresentation()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-client-sdk";
try {
    var presentation = DID.createPresentation(credentials);
    console.log('success', presentation);
} catch (err) {
    console.err(err);
}
```

### Submit VC or VP to Verifier

There are two main methods to submit VP to verifier. The first one is to include the VP in the DID authentication response and submit it to verifier. See more information in [the section here](./3-did-auth). The second one is to storage the VP in SDS and give access grant of the VP to verifier.

### Verify VC from Issuer

The operating client verifies the digital signature of the VC from an issuer.

**Unid.validateCredential()**
```js
import { Unid } from "@unid/react-native-unid-client-sdk";
try {
    var result = async Unid.validateCredential(receivedCredential);
    console.log('completed:', result);
} catch (err) {
    console.err(err);
};
```
