On this page, we will demonstrate how to create a verifiable credential in a JSON-LD format adhering to the [W3C VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

### VC Lifecycle
This section provides a concrete set of simple but complete lifecycle examples of the data model expressed in one of the concrete syntaxes supported by this specification. The lifecycle of credentials and presentations in the Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem often take a common path:

1. Issuance of one or more verifiable credentials.
2. Storage of verifiable credentials in a secure data storage (SDS).
3. Composition of verifiable credentials into a verifiable presentation for verifiers.
4. Verification of the verifiable presentation by the verifier.

### Create SIVC (Self-Issued Verifiable Credential)
Here, in order to understand the VC operating way, we will introduce the procedure to generate SIVC (self-issued VC). If you want to see issuance of VC through UNiD Issuer Kits, please click [here](../rp/1-issuer-kit).

Let's create [AddressCredentialV1](../schemas/address) through UNiD React Native SDK.

**DID.createCredential()**
```js
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

var AddressCredentialV1 = DID.createCredential({
    "@type": "AddressCredentialV1",
    "postalCode": "1500044",
    "addressCountry": "JP",
    "addressLocality": "Tokyo",
    "addressRegion": "Shibuya-ku",
    "streetAddress": "5-5, Marumaya-cho"
});
```

Great! Now that you've completed to create a JSON-LD verifiable credential. Next is to storage the credential to a Secure Data Storage (SDS) in a secure manner.

### Storage VC in SDS

The operating client can securely access the SDS endpoints that provided by the tenant. The client can encrypt `AddressCredentialV1` with `EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019` and storage it in the SDS in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.

**DID.postCredential()**
```js
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

async function DID.postCredential(AddressCredentialV1){
    return 'complete';
};
```

確認ポイント

- encrypt `AddressCredentialV1` with EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019
- with tenant api_key
- header include SHA512 Hash with tenant secret_key
- SDS endpoint
- "https://docs.unid.plus/docs/2020/credentials/address" as an index key
- anything else?

Great! Now that you've completed to store a credential to SDS. Next is to get selectively credentials stored in SDS and make a verifiable presentation.

### Composition of VC into VP
The client can selectively get VCs from SDS with "@type" as VC metadata.

**DID.getCredentials()**
```js
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

var credentials = DID.getCredentials({
    "@type": [
        "NameCredentialV1",
        "BirthDateCredentialV1",
        "GenderCredentialV1",
        "ImageCredentialV1",
        "EmailCredentialV1",
        "PhoneCredentialV1",
        "AddressCredentialV1"
    ]
})
```

**DID.createPresentation()**
```js
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

var presentation = DID.createPresentation(credentials);
```

Components of VP
- Presentation Metadata ("type": "VerifiablePresentation")
- Verifiable Credentials
- Proof

### Verify VC

クライアントがあるissuerから受け取ったVCのデジタル署名を検証します。

**Unid.validateCredential()**
```js
import * as Unid from "@unid/react-native-unid-sdk";

async function Unid.validateCredential(NewCredential){
    return 'validated';
};
```
