# Introduction

Internet of Thing (IoT) brings DX opportunities to all industries and fields, but it also introduces cybersecurity risks. In recent years, there has been a surge in cyber attacks targeting IoT devices, including ransomware, password list, and supply chain attacks. It is difficult to counter these threats with traditional perimeter defenses alone, and it is essential to implement endpoint security for modern IoT devices.

When implementing endpoint security in IoT devices, the huge initial investment and the operational burden on administrators are major challenges. From the development stage, developers have to consider the unique IoT security requirements and build mechanisms for crypto key management, authentication and authorization, secure two-way communication with the cloud, and device management throughout the product lifecycle. Scratch building such a complex security infrastructure from edge to cloud and constantly monitor a large number of endpoint devices requires a huge budget and a dedicated team. This is a major barrier to introduce endpoint security for IoT devices.

UNiD is a platform that enables any developers to easily implement advanced endpoint security in IoT devices. This documentation describes the overview and architecture of UNiD platform and how to integrate it with your systems.
