# Ubuntu (NodeJS)

This tutorial will explain how to run UNiD EDGE SDK on Ubuntu (NodeJS) environment. This tutorial consists of 4 chapters as shown below, so that you can try all the features of UNiD EDGE SDK by following this tutorial. The execution environment required to proceed with the tutorial is defined as follows:

* Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa) on x86\_64

<<<<<<< HEAD
In addition, UNiD EDGE SDK communicates with the Internet for creating DID (**D**ecentralized **ID**entifiers) and get DID Document to verify the digital signature. Please make sure that your environment is connected to the Internet before proceeding with the tutorial.

## Senario

### [Scenario I. Create a DID](scenario-i.-create-a-did.md)
To learn how to use UNiD EDGE SDK to create a DID on your terminal.

### [Scenario II. Sign Credentials](scenario-ii.-sign-credentials.md)
To learn how to apply digital signature to JSON-LD based structured data using UNiD EDGE SDK.

### [Scenario III. Verify Credentials](scenario-iii.-verify-credentials.md)
To learn how to use the UNiD EDGE SDK to verify the signature of digitally signed JSON-LD based structured data and authenticate that the data has not been tampered with.

### [Scenario IV. Connect with E2E Secure Channel](scenario-iv.-connect-with-secure-channel.md)
Coming Soon...
