# Glossary of terms and abbreviations

**UNiD**  
This is a generic term for the endpoint security platform provided by CG.

**UNiD EDGE**  
UNiD EDGE is an open source middleware to be embedded in devices. It provides general-purpose SDKs designed to support various devices with RoT, operating systems, and transports.

**UNiD HUB**  
UNiD HUB has IAM and message handler functions to bridge edge devices and the cloud. It provides end-to-end authentication channels that enables secure bidirectional communication between every device and the cloud. It provides API and webhook to connect edge devices to various cloud services.

**UNiD Studio**  
UNiD Studio is an application for device management. You can manage and control provisioned devices from UNiD Studio.


**DID**  
A Decentralized Identifier, or DID, is a URI composed of three parts: the scheme did:, a method identifier, and a unique, method-specific identifier specified by the DID method. DIDs are resolvable to DID documents. A DID URL extends the syntax of a basic DID to incorporate other standard URI components such as path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular resource â€”for example, a cryptographic public key inside a DID document, or a resource external to the DID document.

**DID Document**  
DID documents contain information associated with a DID. They typically express verification methods, such as cryptographic public keys, and services relevant to interactions with the DID subject.

**DID Method**  
DID methods are the mechanism by which a particular type of DID and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated.

**Root of Trust (RoT)**  
Root of Trust (RoT) is a source that can always be trusted within a cryptographic system. Because cryptographic security is dependent on keys to encrypt and decrypt data and perform functions such as generating digital signatures and verifying signatures, RoT schemes generally include a hardened hardware module. A principal example is the hardware security module (HSM) which generates and protects keys and performs cryptographic functions within its secure environment.
