# Ubuntu (NodeJS)

This tutorial will explain how to run NodeX EDGE SDK on Ubuntu (NodeJS) environment. This tutorial consists of 4 chapters as shown below, so that you can try all the features of NodeX EDGE SDK by following this tutorial. The execution environment required to proceed with the tutorial is defined as follows:

* Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa) on x86\_64

In addition, NodeX EDGE SDK communicates with the Internet for creating DID (**D**ecentralized **ID**entifiers) and get DID Document to verify the digital signature. Please make sure that your environment is connected to the Internet before proceeding with the tutorial.
