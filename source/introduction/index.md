# Introduction

Internet of Thing (IoT) brings new business opportunities to all industries and fields, but it also introduces cybersecurity risks. In recent years, there has been a surge in cyber attacks targeting endpoint devices, including ransomware, password list, and supply chain attacks. It is difficult to protect against these threats with traditional perimeter defenses alone. The end-to-end security is essential for modern distributed systems composed of IoT devices, microservices, and on-premise servers.

When building end-to-end security, the massive upfront cost and operational burden are major challenges. Especially in the case of IoT, it is often difficult to retrofit security measures on devices, so even before design stage, developers need to consider and define security requirements and specifications about deviceâ€™s keys management, authN/Z mechanisms, secure two-way communication, security update mechanisms after market and so on. It requires a highly expertise and massive budget to build end-to-end security on the distributed systems, and it is a major barrier to introduce IoT security to all industries and fields.

UNiD is an open-source toolkit that enables any developers to simply build end-to-end security between all devices including IoT, microservices, and on-premise servers, using features of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as a basis of security and privacy. This documentation describes the overview and architecture of UNiD and how to integrate UNiD with your distributed systems.
