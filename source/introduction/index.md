# Introduction

While Internet of Thing (IoT) brings new business opportunities to all industries and sectors, it also introduces cybersecurity risks. In recent years, cyber attacks targeting endpoint devices and data in motion on IoT systems have increased rapidly. Traditional perimeter defenses alone cannot prevent such threats; identity centric security is essential for modern distributed systems comprised of IoT and microservices.

When building identity first security for IoT systems, the massive upfront cost and operational burden are major challenges. It is often difficult to retrofit security measures on devices, so even before design stage, IoT developers need to consider and build security infrastructure from edge to cloud, such as device's identity and key management, mutual authentication, end-to-end encryption, dynamic access control, security update after market and so on. It requires a highly expertise and massive budget and is a major barrier to introduce security into all IoT systems.

NodeX is building future where machines own their identity and exchange verifiable data across all digital interactions. Our open-source security infrastructure is standards-compliant, production-ready, and extensible into any type of devices. This documentation offers ways of getting started with NodeX projects.
