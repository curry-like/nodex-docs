# Introduction

Internet of Thing (IoT) brings DX opportunities to all industries and fields, but it also introduces cybersecurity risks. In recent years, there has been a surge in cyber attacks targeting IoT devices, including ransomware attacks, password list attacks, and supply chain attacks. It is difficult to counter these threats with traditional perimeter defenses alone, and it is essential to implement endpoint security for modern IoT devices.

When implementing endpoint security for IoT devices, a large initial investment and the operational burden on administrators are major challenges. From the development stage, developers need to understand the unique security requirements of the IoT and consider mechanisms for crypto key management, authentication and authorization, secure two-way communication with the cloud, and device management throughout the product lifecycle. Building such a complex security stack from scratch and creating a mechanism to constantly monitor a large number of endpoints requires a huge budget and a dedicated team. This is a major barrier to endpoint security implementation.

UNiD is a platform that enables any developers to easily implement endpoint security. Developers can realize advanced endpoint security by simply embedding the middleware, "UNiD EDGE", into devices. This document describes the overview and architecture of UNiD platform and how to use "UNiD EDGE".
