<hr />

UNiD is an open-source toolkit for building end-to-end secure messaging between all devices including IoT, micro services, and on-premise servers, using features of [decentralized identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) as a basis of security and privacy. Build atop [DIDComm messaging protocol](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging) which works over any transports, it makes end-to-end messaging reliable, secure, and easy.

This repo where we develop libraries to be installed into your devices. It enables device's IDs and keys management with root of trust (RoT), automated provisioning, mutual authentication, and end-to-end secure messaging across network boundary.
