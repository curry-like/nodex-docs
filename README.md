## ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the UNiD Documentation!

At UNiD, we are focused on building the new identity stack for the future Web where distributed users and machines are able to interact with verifiable data without the need for third parties. UNiD platform makes it easy for any developers to integrate decentralized identity capabilities into existing services by providing a full set of toolkits such as underlying protocols, DIDs, VCs, digital wallet and encrypted storage.
