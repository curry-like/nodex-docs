# Welcome

## ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the UNiD Documentation!

UNiD is an easy to integrate, adaptable decentralized identity platform. Decentralized identifiers \(DIDs\) are a new type of identifier that allow us to own personal information and selectively disclose it across platforms and services in a privacy preserving manner.

UNiD platform is built on the top of an open, public, and permissionless 2nd layer protocol for decentralized PKI and composed of pluggable and extensible building blocks such as core APIs, drivers, and toolkits. It can be scaling to billions identifiers and interoperable based on open web standards at organizations such as the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/), [IETF](https://ietf.org/), and [the Hyper ledger Project at the Linux Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/). 

We are excited to reimagine the new identity stack for future web where distributed users and machines are able to interact with verifiable data without the need for the third party.
