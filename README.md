# Welcome

## ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the UNiD Documentation!

At UNiD, we are focused on building the new identity stack for the future Web where distributed users and machines are able to interact with verifiable data without the need for third parties.

UNiD is a full-stack decentralized identity platform that provides underlying protocols, decentralized identifiers \(DIDs\), verifiable credentials \(VC\), digital wallets, encrypted storage, and SDKs. We make it easy for any developers to integrate UNiD into existing services with common standards.
